## AR-Bot
<p align="justify">
  First program I've ever made in python back in 2019. This program simulates a bot that could do various random tasks for entertainment purposes.
  The code has long since been abandoned but I uploaded it for nostalgia's sake and for the sake of storing my journey in python.
  Some of the code may not work now as some of the libraries used might've been deprecated.
